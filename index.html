<p>Forest of Zarn is Complex "Choose your own Adventure" game, that barrows classic role playing elements, a three dimensional character viewer, and the best part; customizable adventurer files. The main goal of the project was to develop a game whose story and content can be edited with ease and without redistributing the client for each story update. Exposing the story and its elements in a naked XML means that anyone one can create there own story and share with friends. In addition to making the games story and elements exposed was to make them easy to digest and use so that it's not limited to people who can read and write code. I hope to improve upon the base code that's used in the game to allow more flexibility and diversity for greater story telling and entertainment.</p>

<p>The scripts and tools that I have created for the use of the game are free to use as by license, just note that some of the scripts for UNITY 3D are for reference and that I will NOT be uploading the meta-data for the scripts. Also copies of the game will ONLY be given out as per request for possible employment or as a portfolio at this time.</p>
